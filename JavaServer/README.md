# TcpServer

call like:

> java -jar tcpserver.jar

The only difference between tcpserver.jar and tcpserver_new.jar is how to retreive the IP Address for display in the programms text panel, it wasn't working on my computer and thought it was kind of annoying. You should be able to use the normal tcpserver.jar without problems.
